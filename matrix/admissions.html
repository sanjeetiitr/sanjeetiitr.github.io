        <p>Success in JEE advanced is entirely dependent on fundamental understanding of concepts. Most Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics questions in JEE advanced require a fundamental understanding on the concepts.
On the other hand, a large number pf PMT questions across Biology, Chemistry and Physics are based on memorizing facts and formulas and then quick application in exam in time bound manner.</p>

                <p>Success in JEE advanced is entirely dependention fundamental understanding of concepts. This is because most Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics questions in JEE advanced require a fundamental understanding on concepts.

Hence teachers have to focus on explaining concepts and their applications. And during JEE advanced preparation very little effort and time should be spent on memorizing formulas.

This practice is in line with IIT culture, where most exams are open book and students are allowed to take their books and exams in classroom. This is in direct contrast to medical school examinations where have to remember vast amount of content to do well in exams</p>
